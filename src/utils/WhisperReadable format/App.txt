Worker and Effects:

Initializes a worker using useRef to handle background tasks.
Uses useEffect to set up the worker when the component mounts and to handle incoming messages from the worker.
Audio Handling Functions:

readAudioFrom(file): Converts the selected file or stream into audio data.
handleFormSubmission(): Sends the audio data to the worker for processing.
Rendering:

Conditionally renders components (Information, Transcribing, FileDisplay, HomePage) based on the state (output, loading, isAudioAvailable).
Event Handlers:

handleAudioReset(): Resets the selected audio file or stream.
handleFormSubmission(): Initiates the audio processing when the form is submitted.
